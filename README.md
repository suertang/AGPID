# GAPID
Automatic PID calibration based on genetic algorithm.

This idea comes from flappy bird game AI.(The )

[FlappyLearning](http://github.com/xviniette/FlappyLearning)

This will help you to play the falppy bird game.

I did some modification to make this model automaticlly calibrate the PID parameters.


To install:
```
git clone https://github.com/suertang/GAPID.git```

To run:
```
Open index.html and allow script to run.```

The training will be automaticlly started.

TODO:
1. Update the comments.
2. Maybe I can develop a Nerual Network controlled PID controller.
